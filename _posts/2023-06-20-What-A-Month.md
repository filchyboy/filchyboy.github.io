# Today

* What a month it has been!

* Last week I attended an event at the Meta studios in Playa del Rey for Plug and Play Ventures latest accelerator cohort. The event was hugely educational and not only did I get to engage with some interesting people but I made some useful connections and saw some really impressive product demos.

* We committed to using [Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/) for the platform on DO. Really cool tool. Toolings are getting so easy these days. Such an improvement over 20 years ago, even 5 years ago.
