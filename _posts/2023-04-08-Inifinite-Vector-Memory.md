* [Enhancing ChatGPT With Infinite External Memory Using Vector Database and ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin](https://betterprogramming.pub/enhancing-chatgpt-with-infinite-external-memory-using-vector-database-and-chatgpt-retrieval-plugin-b6f4ea16ab8) this article by Ruolin from Google is superb.

Going to explore integrating this into one of my projects.
