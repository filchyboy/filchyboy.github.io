# Daily Plan - Monday, February 23, 2026

## Today's Theme
I'm in a strong groove with the MCP-TOON integration work - I've been hammering away at the error handling feature set all week (7 commits) and just touched it yesterday, so the context is completely fresh in my head. I want to capitalize on this momentum and push through the core middleware improvements while also advancing the provenance tracking work that's been moving alongside it.

## The Main Work

**Complete the TOON error handling middleware stack** - I've been deep in this feature set with 7 commits this week and worked on it just yesterday, so all the authentication flow details are still loaded in my memory. I need to knock out the nonce column migration, fix the replay attack detection storage, and get the token expiry validation properly integrated into the middleware. This is foundational work that's blocking other MCP features from moving forward.

**Push forward the provenance tracking migration** - This has been running parallel to my error handling work with 8 commits this week, and I've got the database design patterns fresh from working on the nonce column migration. I want to create the provenance tracking migration while the database schema thinking is still hot in my head.

**Address the Porto architecture specification gaps** - I've been actively working on this with 12 commits this week, and since I'm already thinking about the services directory structure from my MCP work, it makes sense to finish updating the porto_rules.yaml and container documentation. This will clean up the architecture violations that have been nagging at me.

**Research one aligned planning item** - Since I'm deep in migration work, I should draft an implementation plan for either the tailwind-migration or vite-7-migration directories. The context overlap will make this much more efficient than switching domains entirely.

## Housekeeping

**Run the auto-fixer for lint issues** - There's 1 auto-fixable warning that I can clear with a single `make lint-fix` command.

**Regenerate the stale PHP test report** - My test results are 31 days old and showing a concerning 7% pass rate. I need to run `make test-fixed-batches-quick` to get current data and see if those 3913 failures are real regressions or just stale environment issues.

**Update route health status** - The route health check is 30 days old, and with 1691 routes showing a fail status, I need fresh data to understand what's actually broken versus what's just stale.

**Clean up markdownlint issues in docs I'm touching** - With 70 markdown issues across 41 files, I'll fix any that come up in the planning directories I'm working with today rather than letting them accumulate.

## Parked

I'm deliberately setting aside the mobile-views and woocommerce planning work even though they're ready for implementation plans. My MCP-TOON integration has serious momentum right now, and I don't want to fragment my focus across completely different domains when I'm making such good progress on the authentication and middleware stack.

## Update - 10:07 AM

Quite the marathon session today - knocked out 161 tasks across 14 different feature areas. The biggest chunk was completing the full Pipedrive CRM integration scaffolding, which I worked through in 7 phases. Started with the API contract verification and basic file generation, then built out the adapter with full CRUD operations for contacts, companies, and deals. The transformer pairs were particularly satisfying to implement - getting the bidirectional data mapping right between Pipedrive's organization structure and my standard schema always requires some careful thought. Wrapped that up with OAuth flows, comprehensive testing, and documentation.

I also shipped the complete waitlist admin UI - 24 tasks from routes and controllers through to the metrics dashboard and bulk operations. The permissions system integration went smoothly, and I'm pleased with how the tenant isolation verification turned out. Had several smaller slices to close out too: got the accessibility compliance status endpoint wired up with proper fallback behavior, finished the Mailchimp connection testing flow, and completed the billing revenue analytics with real data aggregation. The tracker status system rollout was more administrative but necessary - updated all the planning workflows and regenerated checklists with the new status taxonomy. Even managed to squeeze in some infrastructure work with the local secrets vault using SOPS+Age, which should make development environment setup much more secure.

## The Numbers
- Additional tasks: 161
