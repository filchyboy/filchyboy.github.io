# Daily Plan - Thursday, January 22, 2026

## Today's Theme
I'm laser-focused on the internationalization feature set today. I've made 10 commits this week and touched it just yesterday, so the context is incredibly fresh in my head. I've got 8 unit tests ready to implement, and they're all scoring identically at 22.5 (recency +4.5, momentum +3.0). This is clearly where my strategic focus has been, and I want to keep that momentum rolling while the mental model is still loaded.

## The Main Work

**Complete locale resolution testing (i18n-p7-unit-locale-resolution-2 & i18n-p7-unit-locale-resolution-3)**
I've been deep in the i18n work all week, and these locale resolution tests are fundamental to everything else. I need to verify that the Accept-Language header parsing works correctly and that user preferences properly override it. Since I was working on this feature set yesterday, I can jump straight in without any context-switching overhead. These tests will validate the core mechanism that every other i18n feature depends on.

**Implement currency formatting tests (i18n-p7-unit-currency-1 & i18n-p7-unit-currency-2)**
With 10 commits in this feature set this week, I'm in the zone on internationalization patterns. Currency formatting is critical for a SaaS platform - getting USD and EUR formatting right will establish the patterns for all other currencies. I want to tackle these while the locale resolution work is still warm in my mind, since currency formatting depends on locale context.

**Build out number and date formatting tests (i18n-p7-unit-number-1, i18n-p7-unit-number-2, i18n-p7-unit-date-1)**
These are natural follow-ons to the currency work. Number formatting (thousands separators, decimal handling) and date formatting are the other pillars of i18n. All eight tasks in this feature set have identical scores, so there's no artificial priority between them - I'm just working through them systematically. Getting these done today would mean I've completed the entire unit test suite for the core i18n functionality.

**Test JsonFileProvider loading (i18n-p7-unit-provider-1)**
This validates how we're actually loading translation files. It's part of the same momentum wave (recency +4.5, momentum +3.0), and I need it working correctly before I can trust any of the formatting or resolution logic in production scenarios. Since I'm already in test-writing mode with fresh context, this fits naturally into today's flow.

## Housekeeping

**Review planning pipeline directories needing research**
I've got four directories flagged as "Needs Research" - task-management, integration, performance, and metadata. I should at least peek at one of these (probably performance, since it has "active" plans) to see if there's something I can advance 15-20 minutes today. Not enough to break my i18n momentum, but enough to keep future work moving.

**Check on the 24 directories needing implementation plans**
That's a lot of directories stuck in the "has research but needs plan" state. I won't tackle any of them today - my momentum is clearly in i18n execution - but I should at least note which ones might be good candidates for tomorrow or next week when I need to shift gears.

## Parked

Nothing is blocked right now, which is great. I'm deliberately setting aside any temptation to jump into the planning pipeline work or start something new. The behavioral signals are crystal clear: I've been investing in internationalization all week, I touched it yesterday, and I have 8 clean tasks ready to execute. Fighting that momentum would be silly. The quality reports are unavailable anyway (dev-tracker API not running), so there's no technical debt screaming at me. Today is an i18n day, plain and simple.

## Update - 09:56 AM

Today was one of those marathon coding days where I tackled some major infrastructure overhauls that had been on my list for way too long. The big win was completely rebuilding the waitlist system to use my flow engine architecture instead of the old custom implementation. This meant creating a whole StepRegistry system to handle flow steps, wiring up the FlowEngine properly, and building new tasks for contact upsertion and email sending that integrate with my CDP and communications infrastructure. The old system was getting brittle, so migrating to flows gives me much better flexibility for complex signup workflows.

I also spent significant time on the WooCommerce integration, working through design token compliance and accessibility requirements. The automated sync task system is finally solid - documented everything from the Laravel Scheduler configuration to troubleshooting guides. Had to enhance the webhook processing system too, adding proper idempotency handling and dead-letter queues for failed webhooks. It's one of those features that's not glamorous but essential for reliability at scale.

The waitlist admin UI came together nicely as well - built out all the CRUD operations, permissions system, and management views that my team needs. Plus I did a cleanup pass on the old waitlist signup system, consolidating everything into proper Porto architecture patterns. The codebase feels much more coherent now that these three systems are all following the same architectural principles.

## The Numbers
- Additional tasks: 113
- Feature areas: col-xxxx-waitlist-infrastructure-integration, waitlist-admin-ui, woocommerce, waitlist-signup
