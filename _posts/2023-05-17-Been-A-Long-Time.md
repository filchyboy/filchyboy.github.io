# Today

* I need to find a less expensive form/survey builder than Typeform. I love the application but damn it's gotten expensive. We recently took it upon ourselves to go over all of our tech platforms with the intent to get rid of those we can push onto something less expensive.

* One of the ones to go is Dropbox Paper. What a mess that has become over the years. I was such a fan when it came out. But it just gets worse and worse. The UI & UX is so confusing. I'd so love to come into the company and help them sort this out. My biggest issue though is how they migrated their code base from `paper.dropbox.com` to `dropbox.com`. This has resulted in too many issues to cover the last couple of years or so and despite our being baked in on this tool it has got to go. We started planning a migration to Notion for the pieces currently running through Paper and that too will be complicated as there is no simple way to have someone get a link and then create and account and then get back to the Notion page they were sent. Too many steps involved for our users. Sigh.
