# Daily Plan - Tuesday, February 10, 2026

## Today's Theme
I'm in a good position to finish the internationalization work that's been my focus lately. At 76% complete and with fresh context from yesterday's work, I can push through the remaining 8 items and actually complete a major feature set. This feels like a "finish strong" kind of day.

## The Main Work

**Wrap up i18n override management** - I worked on this yesterday so the context is still fresh in my head. I need to add the UI for editing existing overrides and create the add-locale.sh script. These are the core remaining pieces that other team members have been asking about.

**Complete the i18n CI/CD validation** - The character length validation and pipeline testing with violations will round out the automation side. Since I'm already deep in the internationalization domain, it makes sense to finish this while I have all the context loaded.

**Knock out the remaining unit tests** - The locale resolution test for super-admin override, date formatting with time zones, number formatting for percentages, and relative time for past events. These are the final pieces to get the i18n feature set to 100% completion.

**Push the frontend work that's been happening** - I noticed 10 commits of untracked activity around localizing admin table filters. I should make sure this work gets properly integrated and documented since it's clearly been a focus.

## Housekeeping

**Run `make lint-fix`** - This will auto-fix 4 errors and 1,226 warnings in one command. Since I'll be touching frontend code anyway, cleaning up the linting issues makes sense.

**Refresh the lint harness snapshot** - It's 32 days old and I should run `make lint-harness-snapshot` to get current quality metrics.

**Draft implementation plan for frontend-gate-implementation** - Since I'm already working in frontend territory today, this planning task aligns well and could set me up for future work.

**Address those 26 TypeScript errors** - They're spread across 11 files and likely missing type imports. Since I'm in the frontend domain today, I can tackle a few of these.

## Parked

The other feature sets in "Ready to Start" aren't getting attention today - I want to actually finish internationalization completely rather than starting new streams of work. The test failures and route health issues are concerning but they're not blocking my current focus, and tackling them would derail the momentum I have on i18n completion.

## Update - 08:25 PM

Spent the evening digging into that Dagger manifest issue that's been bothering me. The problem was becoming clearer - my BuildAssets function wasn't returning what the pipeline actually needed. Started by setting up a proper planning directory to think through the approach, then dove into the code changes.

The core fix was changing the BuildAssets return type to include the actual directory alongside the error handling. Instead of just running the build and hoping for the best, I'm now properly returning the build directory from the container so downstream steps can actually access the assets. Tested it locally on my Mac mini to make sure the changes work before pushing anything to the staging environment. Wrapped up by updating the staging pipeline documentation to reflect the new behavior - future me will thank present me for that.
