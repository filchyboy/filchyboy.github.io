# Daily Plan - Wednesday, January 14, 2026

## Today's Theme
Architecture compliance day - spent most of my time bringing two major feature sets up to production standards.

## The Main Work

Today was all about crossing the finish line on internationalization and making serious headway on the WooCommerce integration. I wrapped up the i18n system by translating all the authentication flows - login forms, registration, password resets, 2FA setup, and email verification. Had to expand both the auth.json and navigation.json files with complete string coverage, which was more tedious than expected but necessary for proper localization.

The testing side of i18n took up a good chunk of time. I worked through the entire locale resolution system - testing header overrides, user preferences, tenant defaults, browser detection, and the priority hierarchy that ties it all together. The JsonFileProvider needed thorough testing too, covering getTranslations, setTranslation, and getCoverage methods. Finished with the API endpoint tests, including proper error handling for invalid locales and namespaces. Even got into RTL layout testing and accessibility tests for the auth forms, which revealed a few layout quirks I'll need to address.

On the WooCommerce side, I focused on Porto architecture compliance for the Core/ETL container. Created the proper Actions and Tasks directory structure, ensuring Actions orchestrate Tasks without direct model access and keeping Tasks atomic and reusable. Implemented the OAuth credential validation logic and got API connectivity working with the WooCommerce REST API. The connection testing now returns proper DTOs with latency metrics, and I built out the orchestration logic for all 7 entity types we're supporting.

Both feature sets passed their quality gates - PHPStan analysis, Porto audits, and frontend linting all came back clean. I also documented the test patterns for the WooCommerce integration, which will save time when other developers pick up future phases.

## Looking Ahead
With i18n fully tested and WooCommerce's core ETL foundation solid, I can start building the actual data synchronization workflows tomorrow.

## The Numbers
- Completed: 40 tasks
- Feature areas: internationalization, woocommerce
