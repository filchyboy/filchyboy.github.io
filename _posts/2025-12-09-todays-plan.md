# Daily Plan - Tuesday, December 09, 2025

## Today's Theme

I need to finish up the JSDoc strategy work I started, then knock out some critical priority-1 tasks that have been waiting. I'm particularly focused on the agent registry work since several tasks there are ready to go, and I want to maintain momentum on that feature set.

## The Main Work

**Wrap up the JSDoc documentation strategy** - I'm already deep into Phase 3 of the frontend linting work, and I've got the context loaded. I should finish establishing the JSDoc conventions and guidelines so I can close out this phase cleanly. This has been in progress and leaving it half-done would just mean reloading all that context later.

**Run quality gates on the agent registry** - This is a priority-1 task with only 2 effort points, and it's about verifying compliance before I go deeper into the agent-version-update-service work. I need to make sure what's built so far meets my standards before I pile more work on top of it.

**Create the service provider for agent registry** - Once I've verified the quality gates, I'll set up the service provider and register the bindings. This is foundational work that other agent registry tasks will depend on, so getting it done today unlocks future progress.

**Add those helper methods to foundation** - The `getBoolean` and `getTenantAware` helpers are straightforward additions that I know will make configuration work cleaner. It's a small effort-2 task that gives me a nice sense of completion while also being legitimately useful.

## Housekeeping

**Tackle the top ESLint offenders** - That `index.ts` file with 88 errors is screaming at me. I don't need to fix all 279 errors today, but I should at least make a dent in the worst file. It'll improve my overall ESLint status and make the codebase feel more maintainable.

**Look at those failing Jest tests** - I've got 3 tests failing out of 4,135, which means my pass rate is 98.3%. That's close to green, and tracking down those 3 failures shouldn't take too long. I'd rather not let failing tests linger and become "normal."

## Parked

I'm deliberately not touching the CDP rollback procedures today even though it's priority-1. I want to focus on the agent registry momentum, and rollback work requires a different mindset. The database migrations and Eloquent models for agent registry are also staying parked - those are effort-3 tasks that I'll tackle once the lighter foundational pieces are in place.
