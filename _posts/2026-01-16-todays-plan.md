# Daily Plan - Friday, January 16, 2026

## Today's Theme
I'm wrapping up the week with some high-momentum finishes. I've got two items I touched just yesterday that are sitting at the top of my queue, and the internationalization feature set has been absolutely on fire this week with 123 commits. Today feels like a good day to knock out those recently-touched items and then drive forward on the i18n testing work that I've been so deeply invested in.

## The Main Work

**Re-enable the ETL sync scheduler integration**
I worked on this yesterday (recency score +5.0), so the context is completely fresh in my head. The task is straightforward - I need to update Kernel.php to use RegisterETLSchedulesAction. This has strong momentum (+3.0) behind it, and since I was just in this code, I know exactly what needs to happen. Getting the scheduler properly re-enabled will unblock some of the ETL work that's been waiting.

**Migrate SsoLogoutButton to use the centralized toast UX**
Another one from yesterday (recency +5.0), and it's part of cleaning up how I handle SSO logout errors across the platform. The momentum score (+3.0) tells me I've been actively working in this area. Since I already built out the useAuthError hook, migrating this logout button is just about applying the pattern I established. It'll give me consistent error messaging across the SSO flow, which has been bothering me.

**Drive forward on i18n unit testing**
The internationalization feature set has 123 commits this week - that's where my strategic focus has clearly been. I touched this 2 days ago, so the context is still warm. I've got six testing tasks all scored at 22.0, and I want to make meaningful progress on at least 3-4 of them today:
- Locale resolution with Accept-Language headers
- User preference locale resolution  
- USD and EUR currency formatting
- Date and number formatting tests

These are all foundational tests that validate the i18n infrastructure I've been building. Given how much momentum I have here, it makes sense to stay in this zone and build out the test coverage while everything's fresh.

## Housekeeping

**Fix that ESLint error in colorUtils.ts**
There's literally one ESLint error in the entire frontend codebase, and it's in colorUtils.ts. That's been nagging at me - I should just knock it out and get back to a clean slate.

**Start documenting the tailwind-migration implementation plan**
The migration is 39.1% complete, I've got artifacts in place, but I haven't written out a concrete implementation plan yet. I should spend 30 minutes sketching out the next phase so I'm not constantly context-switching when I pick this back up.

## Parked

The rest of the i18n testing suite (the other 2-3 tasks I won't get to today) will roll into next week - they're not going anywhere and the momentum will carry forward. All the planning pipeline items that need research or implementation plans are staying on the backburner for now. I need to stay focused on execution today, not planning. The PHPStan errors (8,606 of them) continue to mock me, but that's a dedicated cleanup effort I'll tackle when I have a clear run at it - not something to weave into a day like today.

## Update - 09:46 AM

Made serious headway on two major fronts today. First, I completed the second phase of internationalization work across the React components. This involved translating all the navigation elements - main menu, breadcrumbs, page titles, tabs, and sidebar menus - plus updating every form component (Input, Select, Button, Textarea, Checkbox, Radio) to support i18n. The validation message translation system was particularly satisfying to build out, as it handles dynamic error messages across different locales. Wrapped up with some RTL testing and long text validation to make sure everything holds up under real-world conditions.

The WooCommerce integration work was more involved than I expected. Started with the backend infrastructure - transaction boundaries, structured DTOs, Laravel Scheduler commands, and background job queues. Then moved into the frontend styling, applying BEM naming conventions and design tokens across three new CSS modules totaling about 500 lines. The sync monitor component now has real-time progress bars per entity type, and I built out a complete sync configuration interface with cron expression builders and incremental vs full sync toggles. The Integration Hub now displays WooCommerce status cards with live metrics, all connected through new controller methods and API routes. Even got WebSocket integration working for the live updates, with polling fallback for reliability.

## The Numbers
- Additional tasks: 44
- Feature areas: internationalization, woocommerce
