# Today

* I've been writing a local client for [DeepSeek Coder](https://platform.deepseek.com/). Really fascinating project. I'm setting up this client to be an assist to my coding efferts. It turns out that isolating ticks "```" to denote code blocks is a tricky proposition as any code blocks that have ticks in them don't work so well with regex functions. Really curious. I have a solution but it is far more combersome than I think the problem deserves. I don't really anticipate this will help me with any coding projects per se but I've never written a chat client before so it's a fun and challenging project.
