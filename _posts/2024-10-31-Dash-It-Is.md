# Today

* I encountered an insurmountable issue with Hoppscotch related to OAuth implementation and have decided it's best to stick to Postman for now.

* I have been refactoring my financial projections application once again. As I have no time table to adhere to and have had the luxury here of building this out as well as I can I'm quite happy with this effort. My initial attempts at building out Dash apps 4+ years ago when I first learned of the framework are an embarassment now. (I know that is not really a legit concern - everyone who learns something does it badly when they start.) I've gained much deeper knowledge of dependency injection principles as a result of this latest refactoring.
