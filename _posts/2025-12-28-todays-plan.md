# Daily Plan - Sunday, December 28, 2025

## Today's Theme
I touched a lot of different feature sets today during my planning session, and now I need to focus that energy. The behavioral signals are screaming at me to finish the ETL scheduler work - I've got fresh context loaded and high momentum (score of 22-23 across all three tasks). I also want to knock out that scope violation test for MCP Toon since I'm already in that headspace.

## The Main Work

**1. Complete the MCP Toon scope violation test**
I literally touched this today and it's sitting in my "In Progress" column. The context is completely fresh in my head - I know exactly what needs to be tested here. This is about ensuring the MCPToonGuard properly rejects requests that violate scope boundaries. Getting this done clears my only in-progress item and gives me a clean slate.

**2. Build out the ETL scheduler registration flow**
This feature set has my highest behavioral scores (22-23 across the board) because I touched it today and have strong momentum (3.0 momentum score). I need to create the GetScheduleConfigurationsTask, then the RegisterETLSchedulesAction, and finally update Kernel.php to wire it all together. The recency boost (+5.0) means I have the architecture fresh in my mind - I was just thinking through how this needs to work. This re-enables automatic ETL syncing, which is critical infrastructure.

**3. Wire up the daily alert frequency reset job**
Another feature set I touched today with high scores (22-23). I need to create the ResetDailyAlertFrequencyJob class structure and register it in Kernel.php. This is related to the scheduler work above, so doing them together makes sense while I'm in that "scheduled jobs and Kernel registration" headspace. The alert system needs this to function correctly - without it, daily frequency counters just accumulate forever.

**4. Harden the APP_DEBUG default configuration**
Small but important security task that's scored at 23.0 because I touched it today. I need to update the APP_DEBUG default in the .env.example and add a security warning comment. This is literally one file, but it's about preventing production security issues. Since I've got the context loaded from today's planning, I should just knock it out.

## Housekeeping

**Update SsoLogoutButton to use centralized error handling**
This scored 22.0 and I touched it today, so the context is there. It's about migrating the SsoLogoutButton component to use the useAuthError hook for consistent toast UX. This is a good break between the Laravel scheduler work - switching between backend and frontend helps keep my mind fresh.

**Run the existing policy tests after yesterday's refactoring**
I touched the refactor-getpolicyname work today (score: 22.0), and before I go further, I need to validate that my changes didn't break anything. Running the test suite is basic due diligence, and it'll tell me if I need to adjust course on that refactoring work.

## Parked

I'm deliberately setting aside the `run-policy-tests` as a stretch goal rather than core work - if the main ETL and MCP tasks take longer than expected, I can push that verification to tomorrow. The PHPStan issues (2,225 errors) and Jest failures (93 failed tests) are calling to me from the quality reports, but those represent deeper rabbit holes that would derail my momentum on the scheduler and MCP work. The accessibility score of 30% is painful to look at, but that's a multi-day effort that needs dedicated focus, not Sunday afternoon attention.

The planning pipeline items in "Needs Research" and "Needs Implementation Plan" are important future work, but today is about execution on what I've already got context for. I've built the momentum - now I need to ship.

---

## Update - 06:56 PM

Today was one of those days where the scope of what I tackled almost feels unreal when I look back at it. I worked across 30 different feature areas, completing 844 individual tasks - everything from deep cryptographic implementation work to internationalization polish to security hardening.

The biggest chunk of work went into the decision layer system, where I built out the complete foundation for automated decision-making in the platform. This involved creating all the database migrations for conversations, decision records, and approval workflows, then implementing the core services - policy authority, routing logic, Slack integration for approvals, and the MCP tool execution pipeline. It's satisfying to see how the pieces fit together: a Slack event comes in, gets routed through the decision matrix, triggers approval requests, and eventually executes approved actions through the MCP interface. The immutability requirements for decision records added some complexity, but that's exactly what we need for audit trails.

Parallel to that, I made significant progress on the cryptographic keys and blockchain infrastructure. The crypto-erasure system is now mostly complete - I've got the KMS drivers, encryption services, key lifecycle management, and the Merkle tree anchoring working together. The dual-read rewrap functionality for key rotation is particularly neat - it lets us migrate keys without breaking existing encrypted data.

I also pushed hard on internationalization, working through 205 tasks to get the platform ready for multiple locales. Created the complete translation infrastructure, converted all the CSS to logical properties for RTL support, built the admin interfaces for translation overrides, and documented the entire workflow. The amount of detail work here - from form validation messages to invoice line items to dashboard widgets - really drives home how much text is embedded in a modern web application.

The security configuration work feels like it'll pay dividends down the road. I hardened the default .env settings, implemented proper CSP headers with admin route detection, enabled all the password policy defaults, and built a security audit command. These aren't flashy features, but they're the kind of foundation work that prevents problems later.
