* This recovery has been a hard one. I'm almost 2 weeks out from the third time having my shoulder cut open in the last 12 months and it seems to be almost as hard as the first time after the calamitous injury followed by the insurance debacle. My head is starting to engage again after the meds and the trauma to my body. Glad of that!
* We've decided it's time to make the Colossal Project a thing. I've been sorting out next steps. So far it looks as though we are going to apply to be a part of the summer cohort at [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/). I've made queries with a number of friends recently who are involved in the VC sector and have gotten some useful advice. This week I checked to see if we have any legal constraints from moving on this and began developing a plan to raise the funds needed to bring this to fruition. At this point I don't know if we will need to rebuild our code or if we can use what we have. Lots to be sorted out here.
