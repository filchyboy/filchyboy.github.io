# Daily Plan - Monday, December 22, 2025

## Today's Theme
A deep dive into metadata and retrospective tooling - building systems that help me understand my own work better.

## The Main Work

Today was split between two major infrastructure pushes that both revolve around better tracking and understanding of development work. The tracker status system got a complete overhaul - I extended the WorkStatus enum in schemas.py to handle more nuanced status categories, then worked through the ripple effects across the codebase. Updated TrackerEntry and WorkUnit models with proper metadata fields, added Pydantic validation to ensure the data stays clean, and rebuilt the status reporting in build_work_units.py to use the new taxonomy.

The documentation side needed attention too - created a proper status taxonomy in PLANNING-WORKFLOW.md and updated the agents reference documentation. Then I built a sync script to generate implementation checklists from tracker data and ran it across all the safe planning directories. The mcp-toon-integration branch needed some cleanup, so I converted the cancelled items to the new format and merged in the latest from develop.

The other major piece was getting the commit-driven retrospective system off the ground. Built out a complete toolkit - commit parser with conventional commits support, a classifier that does multi-factor analysis of commit content, and a clustering algorithm that groups related work into coherent themes. Added CLI tooling to tie it all together and integrated everything with the Jekyll publisher so the retrospectives can flow right into the build-in-public pipeline. Created test scripts for each component to make sure the parsing and classification logic actually works.

The commit analysis is revealing - 45 commits today but only 2.2% were tracked in planning. That's a lot of untracked infrastructure work and crisis responses, which explains why some days feel more chaotic than the planning suggests.

## Looking Ahead
These systems should give me much better visibility into what's actually happening versus what I planned to happen. The retrospective tooling especially should help identify patterns in the untracked work.

## The Numbers
