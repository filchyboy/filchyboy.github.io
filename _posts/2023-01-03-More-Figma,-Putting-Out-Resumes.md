* Spending more time today with Nima Tahami's course on Figma design.

* I finally completed my resume updates. In this last round of hiring, I focused a lot on looking for patterns in the applicants' attention to detail in their resumes. Many people do not understand how to present themselves on such a canvas as a resume. It feels like something like a coffee chat resume review would be a helpful service to many people. I am considering whether this is something I could offer.
