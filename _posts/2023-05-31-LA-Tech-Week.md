# Today

* My original understanding of [LA Tech Week](https://www.tech-week.com/) was quite off. I incorrectly assumed it would be like conventions I have attended, but it's nothing like that. I'm attending at least a couple of events: one coffee chat & one happy hour. My original intention for us to be ready to pitch by the event was in error, both because we haven't been able to prepare the code demo for such an event and because you have to have the juice to pitch at these formal pitching events. But fortunately, my advisor(s) have us set up for individual introductions at a later date when we are ready. So I will go and get my feet under me and get to know the LA entrepreneur community.

* We have begun the process to form the corporation behind our startup. I'm both excited and scared by what the future brings. I'm really taking a risk here. Growth that way lies.
