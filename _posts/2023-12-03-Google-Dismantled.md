# Today

* Got back from vacation where I gained a bunch of weight. Lol. Aging, man.

* I know several engineers and product people at Google and this [piece by Hixie](https://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1700627373&source=post_page-----0e3bf56924ac--------------------------------) reflects the unhappiness they have expressed to me. Increasingly it seems the firm is in for a reckoning of some sort. I chatted with my daughter a bit about this on the drive back to LA. I'm still a docs and sheets user and while the email system is still better than others it seems increasingly my attachment to Google products is getting frayed. *Still* is carrying a lot of weight in that sentence. I could easily migrate out of the G ecosystem and not look back - just as I did many years ago when I moved away from Android.
