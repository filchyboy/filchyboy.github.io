# Daily Plan - Sunday, February 22, 2026

## Today's Theme
I'm in a good rhythm with multiple feature sets showing recent activity - I touched sync latency KPI work, consent status extraction, MCP TOON error handling, and route health fixes just yesterday. Rather than scatter my focus, I want to capitalize on this fresh context and push a few of these initiatives forward meaningfully.

## The Main Work

**Complete the sync latency KPI planning documentation** - I started this work yesterday and have the context loaded. Getting the planning docs finished will clear the path for implementation work later this week. The behavioral signals show this is my most recently active work, so the domain knowledge is right at the surface.

**Create the ConsentStatus enum to replace magic strings** - This refactoring has been on my radar and I touched this planning recently. It's a clean, contained piece of work that will improve code quality across the consent handling logic. Since I've been thinking about this problem space, now's a good time to implement the solution.

**Implement the nonce column migration for TOON error handling** - The MCP TOON work has been getting consistent attention from me lately, and this database change is foundational for the error tracking improvements. I need to get this migration in place before I can build the rest of the error handling features.

**Fix the route health normalization logic** - I've been digging into route health issues recently and identified the specific problems with the normalizeRoutePath function. Since the context is fresh and I understand the edge cases, I should implement the regex-based solution while the problem is clear in my mind.

## Housekeeping

**Run `make lint-fix` to auto-resolve the 1 fixable warning** - Quick command to clean up some lint noise while I'm working.

**Draft implementation plan for tailwind-migration** - Since I'm doing frontend-touching work lately, planning the Tailwind migration makes sense while I'm thinking about the UI layer.

**Investigate the 1 TypeScript error** - Likely a missing import that's easy to resolve, and keeping the TypeScript compilation clean helps catch real issues.

**Regenerate the route health report** - It's 29 days stale and since I'm working on route health fixes today, having fresh data will help validate my changes.

## Parked

The MCP TOON multi-step workflow support and provenance tracking work are both showing recent activity, but they're more complex initiatives. I'm deliberately focusing on the foundational pieces (error handling, database changes) before tackling the workflow logic. The porto architecture specification updates can wait another day since they're documentation changes that don't block development work.

## Update - 09:56 AM

Had one of those productive mornings where I tackled several different areas that have been on my mind. Started by adding rate limit tracking to the Stripe metrics system - nothing fancy, just a new property and method to record when we hit their API limits, plus updates to the persistence layer. The StripeAdapter now catches those 429 responses properly, and I wrote tests to make sure it all works as expected.

Then I dove into the Storybook upgrade I've been putting off. Did it in two phases - first swapped out the deprecated addon-styling for addon-themes, then pushed all the way to v10. The ESM conversion for main.js was straightforward, and those jest-playwright warnings are finally gone. Also made good progress on the CRM integration work, building out the MailchimpCrmAdapter to bridge our CDP container with the existing ETL Mailchimp implementation. Got the factory updated, integration tests written, and documentation in place. Wrapped up by fixing some issues with the route health reporting - replaced the static path mapping with proper regex normalization and improved how we handle auth-protected routes. The summary output now shows a proper breakdown of why certain routes aren't tested, which should make debugging much clearer.

## The Numbers
