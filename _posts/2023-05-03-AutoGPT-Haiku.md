* AutoGPT setup is extremely easy. I really like this tool. I'm not sure exactly how I'm going to use it yet but I have some ideas. It's a very cool tool. I asked it to write some haiku about the sun and the moon:
> Output:
> Haiku 1:
> * The sun and the moon
> * Dancing in the sky above
> * A cosmic ballet
> Haiku 2:
> * Sun and moon entwined
> * Eternal dance in the sky
> * Nature's symphony
> Haiku 3:
> * Sun and moon collide
> * Day and night in constant flux
> * A cosmic balance
