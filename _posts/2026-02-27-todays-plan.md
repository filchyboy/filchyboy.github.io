# Daily Plan - Friday, February 27, 2026

## Today's Theme
I'm riding the momentum from yesterday's work on the thin vertical slices - both tv24 and tv25 have been active in the last 24 hours, so the context is fresh in my head. I want to push these frontend-focused testing efforts forward while they're hot, then tackle some of the high-momentum work that's been building up over the week.

## The Main Work

**tv24-frontend-focused-tests** - I was working on this yesterday, so all the embed mount runtime context is still loaded. This is about getting solid frontend coverage for the publishing form embed hydration, and I know exactly where I left off.

**tv25-focused-tests-contract-and-runtime** - Same story here - I touched this in the last 24 hours, so continuing with the FE/BE contract alignment tests makes perfect sense. The frontend/backend contract work is tricky to context-switch back into, so better to finish while it's fresh.

**comms-baseline-capture-failure-baseline** - I've been putting serious effort into the comms baseline stabilization this week (6 commits), and I need to capture that canonical failure artifact. This is foundational work that unlocks the rest of the comms validation pipeline, and I've built up good momentum in this area.

**comms-baseline-group-failures-by-root-cause** - Following directly from the failure capture, I need to cluster these test failures by their root causes. Since I'm already deep in the comms baseline work, this is the logical next step to make sense of what's actually broken.

**fgate-verify-lint-clean** - The frontend gate implementation has been active this week (11 commits), and getting the linting to pass with zero warnings is a concrete milestone I can knock out. Plus it ties into the overall code quality improvement I've been chasing.

## Housekeeping

**Run `make lint-fix`** - There's 1 auto-fixable warning sitting there, and since I'm working on frontend code today anyway, might as well clean that up with a single command.

**Refresh PHP test results** - The test data is 35 days stale, and with all the comms work I'm doing, I need current failure information. A quick `make test-fixed-batches-quick` will give me fresh data to work with.

**Draft implementation plan for thin-slice-contact-provenance-timeline** - Since I'm already deep in the thin-slice work today, this is a perfect time to sketch out the next related feature while the domain knowledge is active in my head.

**Fix 1 TypeScript error** - Only 1 error in 1 file, probably a missing import. Quick fix that improves the overall build health.

## Parked

The postmark-template work has been really active (18 commits this week), but I'm going to let that sit today since the frontend testing work needs my focus. The comms baseline is more foundational right now, and I don't want to split my attention between email templates and test infrastructure.

## Update - 11:33 AM

Big push today across multiple feature slices - I wrapped up loose ends on the security dashboard and DLQ admin features, then dove deep into three major implementation sequences. The survey insights feature went from contract definition all the way through to the admin panel, including the tricky PII-safe projection work and retention policies. That read model aggregation was more involved than expected, but the API endpoints came together cleanly once I had the data layer sorted.

The realtime admin monitor finally got real data instead of the synthetic curves I'd been using for development. Rewiring from those mock builders to live API data revealed a few gaps in my telemetry, but the activity feed endpoint filled those nicely. Similarly, I migrated both the orders widget and email campaign widget away from their mock fallbacks to proper Dashboard Hub API integration. The email widget migration was particularly satisfying - replaced all that randomized event emission with actual data-backed retrieval. Each slice followed the same pattern: baseline the contract, enrich the telemetry, build the typed frontend service, rewire the components, then lock it down with focused tests and documentation.

## The Numbers
- Additional tasks: 36
