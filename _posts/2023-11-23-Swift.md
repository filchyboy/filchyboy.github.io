# Today

* I have started writing a Swift app for my teaching programs. I think I'll share this as a public repo on my [Github profile](https://github.com/filchyboy). I've got the basic structure down. Now I'm working on accessing core storage and designing my models.

* Colossalistic has our TIN now. #booya
