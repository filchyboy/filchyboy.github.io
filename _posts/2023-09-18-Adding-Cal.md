# Today

* I'm going to deprecate [calendly](https://calendly.com/) and begin using [cal](https://app.cal.com/) if they still exist come the end of my current subscription.
* Well into the white paper process now and it's both completely doable and approachable and also overwhelming.
* I'm formulating an art installation at Burning Man and a team has begun to assemble around my ideas. Crazy cool.
