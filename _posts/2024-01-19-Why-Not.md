[Why to Not Not Start a Startup](https://paulgraham.com/notnot.html) by Paul Graham is interesting, of course, how could it not be? But I found an interesting little tidbit about this in the [Y Combinator Start Up School Curriculum](https://www.startupschool.org/curriculum/why-not-to-start-a-startup): "Another from that batch was Loopt, which is doing so well they could probably be acquired in about ten minutes if they wanted to." So curious. If understand correctly this story of Loopt involves Sam Altman, the future leader of both Y Combinator & OpenAI. Yet, the link is a 404. This link to Loopt could be a way to share so many details around the success of nurturing leadership among Y Combinator cohorts. Oh well, low hanging fruit and all of that.
