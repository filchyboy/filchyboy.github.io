# Daily Plan - Tuesday, February 24, 2026

## Today's Theme
I'm zeroing in on three recently active feature sets where I have fresh context and can make real progress. Yesterday I touched the comms baseline work, accessibility pipeline fixes, and Postmark template refactoring - so I've got that mental context loaded and ready to build on.

## The Main Work

**Capture the canonical Comms baseline failure artifact** - I was working on the comms-baseline-stabilization yesterday, so the context is fresh in my head. I need to establish a solid baseline of what's currently failing before I can effectively group the failures by root cause. This foundational work will make the subsequent analysis much more systematic.

**Fix the Storybook test-runner double-count bug** - I was deep in the accessibility pipeline work yesterday, and this double-count issue is blocking my ability to get accurate test results. The padding calculations are getting counted twice, which throws off all my accessibility measurements. Since I'm already in this domain, I should knock this out first.

**Refactor PostmarkApiClient::listTemplates() for metadata-only returns** - I touched the postmark-template work yesterday, and this refactoring is fundamental to how the template system will work going forward. I need to strip out the heavy template content and just return the metadata, which will improve performance across the board.

**Fix Radio component 44px hit area via CSS** - While I'm in the accessibility pipeline mindset, I should tackle at least one of the component hit area fixes. The Radio component is probably the most straightforward, and fixing it will give me a template for handling the Checkbox and Toggle components later.

**Group failing Comms tests by root-cause cluster** - If I make good progress on the baseline capture, I can move into this analysis work while the failure patterns are fresh in my mind. This will help me understand whether I'm dealing with a few systemic issues or lots of individual problems.

## Housekeeping

**Run `make lint-fix` to clear the auto-fixable ESLint warning** - One command to clean up the codebase while I'm thinking about code quality.

**Draft implementation plan for message-markas-fix** - This aligns with the comms work I'm already doing, and having a concrete plan ready will help when I'm ready to tackle the next phase of message handling.

**Refresh the PHP test results** - My test data is 32 days old, so I should run `make test-fixed-batches-quick` to get current numbers. This will give me a better picture of what's actually broken versus what's just stale.

**Check the single TypeScript error** - It's probably just a missing type import, and since I'll be working in the frontend for the accessibility fixes, I might as well clean this up.

## Parked

I'm setting aside the other accessibility component fixes (Checkbox and Toggle hit areas) until I get the Radio component working properly - that'll give me the pattern to follow. The Sendgrid template refactoring can wait until I've got the Postmark side working, since they should follow the same approach.

## Update - 02:02 PM

What a day. I just wrapped up one of those marathon sessions where you lose track of time because you're deep in flow state. 540 tasks completed across 45 different feature areas - honestly didn't realize the scope until I looked at the numbers.

The biggest win was finally crushing the accessibility pipeline issues that have been nagging at me. Spent hours methodically fixing hit area violations across all our components - Radio, Checkbox, Toggle, Select items - the whole suite. It's tedious work but necessary, and there's something satisfying about seeing those red test failures turn green one by one. Also got the SCSS hard-coding refactor done in 6 systematic batches, replacing magic numbers with proper design tokens throughout the codebase.

The multi-currency price catalogue implementation was a beast - 24 separate pieces including dynamic pricing logic, tax calculation hierarchies, and all the FinOps export functionality. I'm particularly happy with how the caching infrastructure turned out. On the testing front, I knocked out comprehensive test suites for email campaign actions, billing management metrics, and documentation health scoring. The TOTP MFA integration is finally wired up properly too - replaced all the mock data with real API calls and added proper error handling.

Most of the translation overrides API work involved the usual Laravel dance - migration, model, actions, controller, then wire up the frontend. Nothing fancy, but it's solid. The billing reconciliation monitoring system got a major overhaul with 50+ pieces including emergency controls, job retry logic, and bulk operations. That one's going to make operations much smoother.

## The Numbers

## Update - 08:18 PM

What a marathon day. I wrapped up some major architectural work that's been months in the making, plus knocked out several smaller but important features that had been sitting in my backlog.

The big story today was finally completing the DTO layer migration - all 58 tasks of it. I've been methodically working through every container in the platform, moving from the old spatie/data-transfer-object package to spatie/laravel-data. Started with the foundation pieces like the DataObject base class and compatibility factories, then worked through container by container: Core, Analytics, Billing, DesignSystem, HeadlessSDK, Testing, CDP, and ETL. The ETL migration was particularly gnarly since those DTOs handle all the complex sync operations and webhook processing. Finished by cleaning house - removing the legacy base classes, the compatibility shims, and all the composer overrides that were keeping the old package limping along. Running the final validation suite felt good - PHPStan clean, Scribe documentation generation working, no composer warnings. That migration represents a significant step toward modernizing the platform's data handling.

On the feature side, I built out the complete merge suggestion system for CDP contact identity resolution. This one started with database migrations for expiry columns, then grew into a full-featured system with Actions, Tasks, API endpoints, React components, Redux integration, and comprehensive test coverage. The frontend work was particularly satisfying - built reusable components like ConfidenceBadge and MergeSuggestionCard that feel solid and will serve us well as the CDP features expand. Also squeezed in a Jest 30 upgrade (checking compatibility with our image snapshot and accessibility testing setup), fixed the MessageHistory status transition logic that was causing webhook ordering issues, and set up CI integration for the synthetic data emitters.

## The Numbers
- Additional tasks: 117
- Feature areas: merge-suggestion-feature-for-cdp-contact-identity-resolution, jest-30-upgrade, migrate-dto-layer, message-markas-fix, synthetic-data-emitters
