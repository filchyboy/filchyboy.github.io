# Today

* A while back, I found [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/), and after some research, it became clear this could be a good alternative for Postman for the team. Over the last few days, I've deployed it to a Digital Ocean instance. Sadly, I had to enlarge the droplet to make the build, but it's up and running. I added a cert for SSL, and I'm now working out the myriad of issues I have found attempting to run OAuth through GitHub. After I've completed this, I'll take a snapshot and build a new smaller droplet to run this tool from, and hopefully, we will no longer be attached to the price points associated with Postman these days. Indeed, it would have been an easy solution to pay Postman fees, but I've learned a lot from this build, especially adding OAuth, so I'm calling it a win.
