# Today

* Finally pushed a commit for a huge refactor I started 23 days ago. Of course there was the holiday and a lot of traveling and some days off, but wow this has been a relief to finally get back to the direction I was heading before I decided to fix a bit of stray things around configuration. And of course, I decided on a future refactor for my logging system. But that will have to wait.
