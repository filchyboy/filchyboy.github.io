# Today

* Watched the [DevDay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk) event from OpenAI and certainly blown away by it. Most of the existing wrappers such as [Langchain-AI](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) will probably go by the wayside as OpenAI implements their own [GPT.](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts) Sadly my account had not been updated as of last night. Last time they went through a big upgrade it took a few weeks for it to hit my account. Hopefully it doesn't take that long now. I could really use the extra context and input length right now today!
