# Today

* I have been going through a complex CI/CD pipeline over the last few days with a Laravel build. I ended up engaging with the Laravel Herd tooling. Still working out details but I like it's integration with my preferred DB tool TablePlus. We shall see if this tool becomes as useful as it claims to be.

* Yesterday I drove across country but only after the day before I finally was able to get my code-search app running correctly. In the next few days I'm going to clean it up a bit and then deploy it and activate it publicly through Pypi as a package.

* Today I instantiated a free Oracle Cloud instance. As I'm planning on putting a couple of open source projects into the world, code-search being one of them, this might be a good place to host the face of that.
