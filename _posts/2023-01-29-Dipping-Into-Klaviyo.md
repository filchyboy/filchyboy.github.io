* Curious that I was supposed to be engaging with the ShipStation API today and it turned out I don't have access to my account for some unknown reason. Hopefully this will get sorted out soon.
* Started engaging with Klaviyo instead today. Curious, another instance of that type of situation where just the other day I was expressing to a lead that APIs are moved forward incrementally, and just yesterday I found that Klaviyo has advanced the API for the service. Really glad that we are beginning developing our consuming engine for their API right after they moved to the next version rather than just before. It would truly be a shame if we had just finished the day before.
* Just got access to [Tana](https://app.tana.inc/). Been looking forward to messing with this tool.
