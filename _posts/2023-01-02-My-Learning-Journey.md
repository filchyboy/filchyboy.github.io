* I've been on a daily learning journey in my intellectual life since November 2019. Prior to that I had spent many years focusing on a learning journey in my fitness and physical life. That all switched in April of 2019 when I was severely concussed. I'm quite happy at the change that resulted. Years before that I made the switch from daily learning in my intellectual life to that of fitness. I see now I have had two long periods, of many years, where I focused deeply and daily in each of those spheres. Interesting recognition.

* Yesterday I was reminded that I am good at changing my behavior when someone requests me to do so clearly. I think that might be one of the best skills to have in the greater scheme of things. Perhaps when I am dealing with imposter syndrome or wondering why I find this or that thing so tricky, I should remember that at least this skill, I can do this, and it helps in my personal and professional life.

* Today I crafted some detailed charts for some leads & shared with the team for feedback.

* The other day I realized how much work I needed to do to bring my resume up to my current standards and today I spent a long time, probably too long, updating it to reflect how I currently think about my career path and all the things I have done. Quite an exercise, that.
