## Synopsis

* I've been on a daily learning journey in my intellectual life since November 2019. Prior to that I had spent many years focusing on a learning journey in my fitness and physical life. That all switched in April of 2019 when I was severely concussed. I'm quite happy at the change that resulted. Years before that I made the switch from daily learning in my intellectual life to that of fitness. I see now I have had two long periods, of many years, where I focused deeply and daily in each of those spheres. Interesting recognition.
