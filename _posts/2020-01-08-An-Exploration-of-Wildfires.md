## Examining US Forest Service Data - RDS-2019-0005


I've been exploring a data set from the Joint Fire Science Program: Project ID: 14-1-02-27


Here's a few pieces of the work:


1. [A github repository](https://github.com/filchyboy/Examining-US-Forest-Service-Data---RDS-2019-0005)

2. [A post about my exploration on Medium.](https://medium.com/@christopherfilkins/examining-us-forest-service-data-to-learn-about-normalized-burn-ratio-2004cd98500a)

3. [A python notebook of some of my code.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15wQKkfEkI3sKQzGjy43nHCni1g5uFdSp)

Also here's a picture of Solstice Canyon I took in early April of 2019. In the picture you can see the blackened remains of a massive wildfire which consumed the Malibu Hills in 2018.

And here's a picture of my buddy Brian on the same day in early April 2019. The results of the fires of 2018 are more pronounced in this photo.
