# Daily Plan - Wednesday, January 28, 2026

## Today's Theme
I'm in a strong position to make real progress on the SCSS hard-code refactor work that I've been heavily invested in. With 9 commits this week and fresh context from working on it just 2 days ago, I can capitalize on that momentum to knock out several of the remaining plugin updates and configuration changes. This feels like the natural continuation of where my focus has been.

## The Main Work

**SCSS Plugin Exclude Tokens Pattern** - I've been deep in the SCSS refactor work all week (9 commits) and worked on this just 2 days ago, so the plugin architecture is fresh in my mind. Getting the _tokens.scss exclusion pattern working properly will unblock several other tasks in this feature set.

**SCSS CSS Variable Fallback Pattern** - Since I'll already be in the plugin code for the exclude tokens work, it makes sense to tackle the CSS variable fallback pattern while I have the context loaded. This continues the plugin enhancement theme I've been working on.

**SCSS Configuration Excludes Update** - With the plugin changes in place, I can update the postcss.config.cjs excludeFiles to work with the new patterns. This is a natural follow-up to the plugin work and keeps me in the same domain.

**Project File Helper Function** - I've been building out the strict mode functionality as part of this SCSS work, and adding the isProjectFile() helper is another piece of that puzzle. Since I'm already deep in the configuration and plugin code, this fits naturally.

**SCSS Strict Mode Configuration** - This ties together with the project file helper work and represents another step toward completing this feature set that I've been heavily focused on. The strict mode reporting is one of the key goals of this refactor effort.

## Housekeeping

**Run lint auto-fixes** - `make lint-fix` will clear 4 errors and 1,226 warnings in one shot. Since I'll likely be touching SCSS and config files today, getting a clean lint baseline makes sense.

**Refresh lint harness snapshot** - The current snapshot is 19 days stale. Running `make lint-harness-snapshot` will give me current quality metrics, especially useful since I'm doing refactor work.

**Draft Tailwind Migration plan** - Since this has artifacts and is 39% complete, and I'm already working in the CSS/SCSS domain today, I could sketch out some next steps for the Tailwind work while the CSS context is loaded.

## Parked

Setting aside any new feature work today to maintain focus on the SCSS refactor momentum. The mobile views and other planning pipeline items can wait - I want to capitalize on being deep in the SCSS/build tooling domain and make meaningful progress on work I've already invested heavily in this week.

## Update - 12:47 PM

I've been heads-down on three major areas today, making solid progress across the board. The internationalization work dominated my morning - I worked through a comprehensive test suite covering locale resolution (handling Accept-Language headers, user preferences, tenant defaults, and fallback chains), then moved into currency formatting for USD and EUR, date formatting in both short and long formats, and number formatting with proper thousands separators and decimals. The JsonFileProvider got thorough testing too, including the caching mechanisms and tenant override merging. What started as basic unit tests evolved into integration testing for route locale overrides, locale switching without page reloads, and multi-tenant isolation. I even tackled accessibility concerns with screen reader compatibility and RTL keyboard navigation tests.

On the infrastructure side, I built out the staging battery testing system from the ground up. Created the GitHub workflow, implemented the core utility functions in reports_lib.sh, and built the main orchestrator in battery-run.sh. Each testing step got its own implementation - Dagger typechecking, PHPUnit with JUnit XML output, PHPStan with JSON formatting, frontend linting, and system context gathering. The report rotation and fetching mechanisms are solid now, complete with smoke tests and dry-run capabilities. Meanwhile, I've been refactoring my dev-tracker system to read directly from the .reports/ directory instead of hitting the Django API, which should make it much more responsive. Added some intelligence around untracked commit detection, staleness penalties for repeatedly-skipped items, and better adherence measurements. The weekly digest functionality is coming together nicely, complete with AI narratives and automatic Monday triggers.
