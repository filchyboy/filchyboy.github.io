* It's really the case that garbage in garbage out. The 25 interaction limit that OpenAI poses is really a bummer sometimes. I'll teach the model enough to help me with a problem and then we will get to the crux of the matter and then the limit is reached and when it comes back it's like a silly child with no memory and I must teach it all over again. Unfortunately the details are too verbose to put it all together in one prompt so we are stuck in this loop. Sigh. Still, it's an amazing tool.
* Migrated a wiki for the first time. That was kinda nice. It's the simple things.
