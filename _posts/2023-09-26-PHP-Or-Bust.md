# Today

* A couple of weeks ago I was discussing my startup with an associate and he asked about the stack. Curious thing that. I mentioned it's built on Laravel and I could feel his disdain. I laughed at the time. But to be honest, this project landed in my lap with Laravel as the stack. If I had had more of a say it wouldn't have been PHP but Ruby on Rails. Even though I used to, many years ago, actively develop with PHP I would have chosen differently. So many disrespect PHP, including myself, and so this article from the ornery and talented Mr. Knight is well received in my book: [ENOUGH With The PHP Hate](https://medium.com/@deathshadow/enough-with-the-php-hate-2cd07b70f1b0)
