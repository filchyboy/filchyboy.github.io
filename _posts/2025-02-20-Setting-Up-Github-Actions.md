# Today

* [Today](#today) setting up a Github actions workflow today. These runners are so picky! 45 commits as I'm sorting out tiny issues with the workflow. Crazy.
* Shared a PRD I'm building with a fellow dev and she is intrigued. I'm excited to see how this goes.
* Moving all of my personal projects into Jira. I'm using the free tier and it's working well. 
* Working on deploying the theme camp dashboard. Hopefully by the EOW I'll have it deployed and ready to go.
