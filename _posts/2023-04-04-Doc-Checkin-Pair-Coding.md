* Just had a check int with my doc and things are going well.  Still on the bone stim and about to start PT.
* I've been immersed in a new coding project the last few days and I've been experimenting with pair coding with ChatGPT. I really love this. It's a real gas. The AI makes a lot of mistakes, as do I, but between the two of us we are moving quickly through things that would have been slower for me to do by myself. It's especiially cool because my imposter syndrome takes a beating when working with someone else but when working with the AI it is not engaged. And then every time the AI makes mistakes it really helps me think through things trying to disentangle where "we" went wrong. I'm learning a lot about both my habits as a coder as well as the ways in which this AI can be used as an ally in my projects.
* We have not been able to move along fast enough to move forward on the Colossal project and Y Combinator. But we have our servers up and running and are slowly moving forward with integrating things.
* Looks like Github reset their primary key. Took a moment to figure out what was going on and Google didn't do such a good job of pointing out the relevant notice.
