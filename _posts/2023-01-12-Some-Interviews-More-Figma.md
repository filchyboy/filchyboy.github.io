* Last night I got an interesting interview request. We shall see what happens there.
* More work on Figma today.
* I wrote a bit of a blurb for myself:
    > I'm keenly interested in working hard, on my terms, to balance learning, mentoring, and creating opportunities for sound decisions based on good clean data. I want to have a well-balanced work life, do meaningful work in my field, and have a healthy and ethical team with which to do it. I am particularly interested in working on data privacy and accessibility issues for consumers.
