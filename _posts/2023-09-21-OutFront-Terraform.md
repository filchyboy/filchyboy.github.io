# Today

* The organization with which I am involved has been featured in [OutFront Magazine](https://www.outfrontmagazine.com/body-literacy-organization-gives-power-back-to-patients/?fbclid=IwAR2t68TByWfVZKUXNeSVCz7uL2WnfjObVgyhU7SyQkDpE8hIczT-DSdJIjo). Pretty jazzed at this. We have a lot of work ahead of us. Our mission is dope, and the five of us (Adam Be, who was unable to attend for this) are a great team. Honored.
