# Daily Plan - Monday, December 15, 2025

## Today's Theme
I'm starting the week with a focus on accessibility and configuration infrastructure. I've got a solid accessibility report task that'll help me understand where the location views stand, and I want to make meaningful progress on the configuration system that keeps coming up as a dependency for other work.

## The Main Work

**Generate accessibility report for location views** - I need to baseline where I'm at with accessibility in the location views. With my overall a11y score sitting at 30% and those 3,092 Blade violations staring at me, this report will give me concrete data about one specific area. It's a small task that'll inform bigger decisions about how I tackle accessibility systematically.

**Add getBoolean/getTenantAware helpers** - These helper methods are foundational for the configuration system I keep touching. I've noticed I'm repeatedly writing similar code to extract boolean values and handle tenant-aware settings. Getting these helpers in place will make the subsequent RBAC policy and seeder work much cleaner, and I'll be able to use them immediately in other parts of the codebase.

**Create SystemSettingPolicy for RBAC** - This is the natural next step after the helpers. I need proper authorization around system settings - right now there's no clear policy governing who can read or modify these configs. This ties into the larger configuration-opportunities feature set and will prevent me from shipping half-baked permission logic later.

**Guard panel behind feature flag** - The unified build health dashboard needs proper feature flag protection before I can consider it production-ready. This is about resilience and controlled rollout - I don't want to expose unfinished dashboard functionality to users who aren't explicitly opted in.

## Housekeeping

**ESLint cleanup in ColorTokensSection.tsx** - That file has 50 errors sitting in it, which is the second-worst offender in my ESLint report. Since I'll likely be touching design system code soon anyway, I should knock this out while the context is fresh. It's been nagging at me every time I see the report.

**Review planning directory: metadata** - This directory doesn't even have a description yet, and I keep seeing references to metadata concerns across different features. I should spend 20 minutes figuring out what belongs here and writing a brief description so I stop mentally tripping over it.

## Parked

There's no blocked work today, which is great. I'm deliberately setting aside the Groundhogg idempotency work - both the reserve/release pattern and the tests. That's a 3-hour effort for each task, and I want to tackle those when I have a clear morning without interruptions. The session security migration is also sitting at 3 hours, and it's complex enough that I don't want to split my attention with it today.

## Update - 07:42 PM

Today was all about building out the booking system for my calendaring feature - one of those days where I got deep into the domain logic and just kept going. Started with the foundational pieces like registering the CalendarPolicy in the AuthServiceProvider, then built out the core booking actions: ConfirmBookingAction, RescheduleBookingAction, GetBookingAction, and the rest of the booking lifecycle. The GenerateRecurrencesTask was particularly interesting to work on - it handles creating instances from recurrence rules, which required some careful thinking about edge cases and solid unit test coverage.

The second half of the day was spent on the event-driven side of things. Created all the booking events (BookingCreatedEvent, BookingConfirmedEvent, etc.) and their corresponding notifications and listeners. There's something satisfying about building out a proper event system - each booking action now triggers the right notifications and background processes. Also tackled the OAuth integration for external calendar syncing with both Google and Microsoft, plus the background jobs for keeping everything in sync. Wrapped up by adding all the necessary configuration for the API integrations and retry logic. The calendaring system is starting to feel like a real, production-ready feature rather than just a collection of models.

## The Numbers
