# Today

* Back at the end of March, I scheduled my last surgery to remove the titanium from my shoulder. Unfortunately, during the surgery, the surgeon sliced open my jugular vein, and I bled out. This crisis required three transfusions. I woke up a day or so later in the ICU. This fallout has delayed much and has been a massive source of disillusionment. It's now a couple of months later, and I'm starting to recover and find my nerve again. I've begun working on the white paper again and have made significant progress in closing this stage.

* I need to learn how to do this work in public. Doing so will be a significant advantage for the project and my education. I meant this log to be the beginning of that process. I am working on being more proactive in sharing here.
