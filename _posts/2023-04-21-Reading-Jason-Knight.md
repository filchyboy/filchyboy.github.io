* I regularly read Jason Knight's articles on HTML and dev. He's definitely a bit caustic to some but his vibe resembles mine and I enjoy his perspectives on the same stuff in which I have interest. But interestingly it appears that a couple of his articles have been pulled down (I wonder why?):

Great quote from Part 2:
> All these practices I keep advocating — semantic markup, separation of concerns, leveraging selectors instead of slopping extra classes on everything, progressive enhancement so it gracefully degrades — are how you maximize accessibility, speed up page loads, reduce server load, and get your on-page SEO ducks in a row.

Now I can retrieve them. Must be a transient issue. He can be so confrontational it's easy to assume his work has been taken down, or he has decided to do so himself. I love it though. He constantly clarifies for me things I know about semantics and markup that I understand but for which sometimes it feels like I am a lone voice in the wilderness.
