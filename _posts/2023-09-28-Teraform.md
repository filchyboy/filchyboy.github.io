# Today

* We have been exploring using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for our infrastructure. It's a great tool and my associates, and others in the field I have spoken with, are strongly in favor of its use. Alighting on this tool I have learned of its license change. While I don't think this change will effect our project. We have no intention of competing with [Hashicorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/). But it's nice to learn that Terraform has been forked and will remain open source through it's new fork called Tofu: [Linux Foundation Launches OpenTofu: A New Open Source Alternative to Terraform](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/announcing-opentofu)
