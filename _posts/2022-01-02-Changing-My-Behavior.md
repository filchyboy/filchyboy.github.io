## Synopsis

* Yesterday I was reminded that I am good at changing my behavior when someone requests me to do so clearly. I think that might be one of the best skills to have in the greater scheme of things. Perhaps when I am dealing with imposter syndrome or wondering why I find this or that thing so tricky, I should remember that at least this skill, I can do this, and it helps in my personal and professional life.
