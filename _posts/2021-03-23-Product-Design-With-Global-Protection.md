* Last year in 2020, I made a cold connection with the [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/), this seemed like an opportunity to do some data exploration involving the product. One of the minor pieces of the larger condom project back in the day was an analysis I made based on sales-per-state and sales-per-city. We were able to parlay this analysis into a lot of press and PR for the brand at the time. My work, written up in Wired and other national and local papers and magazines, was a lot of fun because people like to make comparisons between places. So sharing a story in which one state has "bigger" penises than another was great fodder for editors. Much to my surprise, the team at Global responded, and we began a conversation that continued for months and ultimately led to my joining the crew.  Due to my depth of knowledge in the sector, I got heavily involved in product design for a new website rollout, which has become a rather large initiative. The team is excellent. I am enjoying my involvement with this company. Back when I worked in the reproductive space decades ago, Global Protection was a company for which I had great respect. I daresay they were then the best outfit in town, and it's incredibly gratifying to come back into the field with them.
