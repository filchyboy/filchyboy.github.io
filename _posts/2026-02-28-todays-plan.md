# Daily Plan - Saturday, February 28, 2026

## Today's Theme
I'm riding the momentum from yesterday's deep work on multiple thin vertical slices. I've got fresh context on the publishing form embed hydration and public flow API alignment from working on them in the last 24 hours, so I want to push those forward. I'm also seeing some architectural housekeeping that's been recently active - the Porto architecture directory recognition work that I touched yesterday needs to be wrapped up.

## The Main Work

**Continue the publishing form embed hydration work** - I was just working on this yesterday, so the frontend testing patterns and embed mount runtime are still fresh in my head. The `tv24-frontend-focused-tests` task is about getting proper coverage for the embed mount runtime, which is critical for the publishing flow stability.

**Push forward on public flow API contract alignment** - This is the other piece I was actively working on in the last 24 hours. The `tv25-focused-tests-contract-and-runtime` work is about ensuring the frontend and backend are properly aligned on contracts, and since I have the context loaded, I should knock this out while it's all still in my head.

**Finish the Porto architecture directory recognition cleanup** - I touched this yesterday and it's one of those administrative tasks that's been nagging at me. I need to add the 8 directories to `porto_rules.yaml`, update the container template in the architecture docs, sync everything to the JSON file, and run the validation. It's straightforward work that I can bang out quickly since I was just in this code.

**Start the public page preview sandbox contract work** - I was recently active on this feature set, and defining the preview rendering path contract (`tv38-contract-preview-rendering-path`) feels like a natural next step. It's foundational work that will unlock the backend preview route implementation.

## Housekeeping

**Run the auto-fix for that 1 ESLint warning** - A quick `make lint-fix` should clean this up without any thinking required.

**Regenerate the PHP test results** - The test data is 36 days old, and with all the recent work I've been doing, I should get a fresh picture of where things stand. I'll run `make test-fixed-batches-quick` to get updated numbers.

**Draft an implementation plan for Porto architecture dependency graphs** - Since I'm already deep in Porto architecture work today, this planning task aligns perfectly. I can leverage the context I'm building around container structures and directory organization.

**Check that 1 TypeScript error** - Probably just a missing import somewhere, and since I'll be doing frontend work anyway, I can knock this out.

## Parked

I'm setting aside the campaign audience targeting work even though it's recently active - the segment reach and targeting validation actions are important but I want to stay focused on the publishing and preview flows today. The various other thin vertical slices that are ready to start can wait until I clear some of the in-progress work off my plate.

## Update - 09:12 AM

What a marathon day - I just wrapped up 91 tasks across 16 different feature areas. The bulk of my time went to completing entire thin vertical slices, and I'm pretty satisfied with how systematically everything came together.

I knocked out 11 complete feature implementations, each following my usual pattern: define the API contract, build the backend action and controller, wire up the frontend component, add telemetry, write focused tests, and finish with docs and quality gates. The survey response CSV export was straightforward - just streaming data with PII safety checks. The VirtualForm admin CRUD panel took a bit more thought around the metadata display, but the React components fell into place nicely. The public page preview sandbox was interesting to build - getting that preview mode banner to feel natural while maintaining security boundaries required some finesse.

The comms baseline stabilization was more tedious work - I had to group failing tests by root cause and methodically fix contract drift issues. The ExternalIdentity `external_id` problems were the worst offenders, but once I aligned the test factories with the current model contracts, everything started passing again. Also spent time getting the Jest 30 baseline stable and cleaning up the SCSS token refactor aftermath. The frontend lint and accessibility checks are finally green across the board, which feels good after that token remediation work.
