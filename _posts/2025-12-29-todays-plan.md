# Daily Plan - Monday, December 29, 2025

## Today's Theme
I'm coming back from the holiday weekend with two high-momentum feature sets demanding attention. Both **container-docs** and **update-accessibility-thresholds** have been getting serious investment (20 and 18 commits this week respectively), and I've got fresh context from work I did just 4-5 days ago. The container-docs work is at 90% completion, so I'm feeling the pull to knock that out completely. I also need to address some accessibility infrastructure work that's been building momentum.

## The Main Work

**1. Get final tech lead approval for container documentation (container-docs-review-tech-lead-approval)**

I've been deep in the container-docs feature set this week (20 commits), and this work is 90% complete. I touched this just 4 days ago, so the context is still loaded in my head. Getting this approval would let me close out this entire feature set, which would feel fantastic. The score of 18.0 reflects that completion bonus - the system knows I'm close to the finish line here.

**2. Document Core/Notification container (container-docs-document-notification)**

Same feature set, same momentum. Since I'm already in the container documentation headspace and likely interacting with the tech lead today for approval, it makes sense to tackle one of the remaining container docs. The Notification container is fundamental enough that having it documented will help with future integration work. All three remaining docs have identical scores (17.0), so I'm picking Notification based on its cross-cutting nature.

**3. Migrate Storybook test-runner hooks from preRender/postRender to preVisit/postVisit (a11y-storybook-hooks-migration)**

This is part of the update-accessibility-thresholds feature set that's been getting heavy attention (18 commits this week). I last touched this 5 days ago, and it's got the highest score (19.5) in that set. This is infrastructure work that needs to happen before I can properly update the coverage thresholds - it's a dependency for the other accessibility tasks. The migration is technical but necessary for the Month 1 milestone work.

**4. Install @storybook/addon-links package (a11y-install-addon-links)**

Still riding the accessibility momentum. This has a score of 18.5 and is part of the same feature set I've been investing in. It's a straightforward installation task that will support the broader Storybook infrastructure improvements. Since I'm already in the Storybook configuration space from the hooks migration, the context overlap makes this efficient to tackle.

## Housekeeping

**Review PHPStan top offenders** - With 2,225 errors across 639 files, I need to at least understand what's happening in ToonTokenVerifierTest.php (37 errors). I'm not committing to fixing everything today, but I should look at whether there are patterns I can address incrementally.

**Check the Jest test failures** - 25 failed tests out of 4,156 isn't catastrophic, but the 97.8% pass rate could slip if I ignore it. I'll spend 30 minutes identifying what's broken and whether any failures relate to the Storybook work I'm doing today.

## Parked

I'm deliberately setting aside the other two accessibility tasks (threshold update and hit-area false positives) even though they're part of my high-momentum feature set. The hooks migration and addon installation are prerequisites, so it doesn't make sense to jump ahead. I'll save those for tomorrow when the infrastructure is properly in place.

The Core/Email and Core/Idempotency container docs are also parked - I want to see how the Notification doc and tech lead review go before committing to more documentation work today. If the approval process reveals changes needed, I'd rather find out before documenting two more containers.

## Update - 07:26 PM

Made some solid progress on the cryptographic side of things tonight. I integrated the Contact model with the S-DEK encryption system, which was one of those pieces that needed to happen before I could really move forward with the secure contact handling. The integration went smoother than expected - the existing S-DEK patterns I've been building held up well when applied to the contact data structure.

Also created the `compliance:merkle-root` CLI command, which gives me a proper way to generate and verify merkle roots for compliance auditing. It's satisfying to have these blockchain-adjacent tools coming together - having a dedicated command for merkle root operations means I can start building more sophisticated compliance workflows without having to manually calculate these values every time.
