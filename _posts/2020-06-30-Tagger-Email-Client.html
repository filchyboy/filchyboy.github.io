<h2>Two Canvas Releases on the Tagger Email Client</h2>

<p>
After a long eight weeks of implementing a lot of new tech and learning how to make many new mistakes, we finished two canvas releases on the Tagger client. I'm proud of what we have accomplished, but there is still a lot to be done. Several of us on the team have expressed interest in working on the client a bit longer. We are trying to get the full set of repos from our work forked. Hopefully, sometime in the fall, we can continue putting together more pieces of the envisioned application.

  Here's the current <a href="https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/tagger-ds">repo</a> for the data science component. I'll be writing this up in more detail in the not too distant future.
