# Images in Responsive Design

* Today I spent some time working on details around [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/using) & [ImageMagik](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/imagemagick) for the use of responsive design.

* I spent more time on standing up a simple Flask app for a professional front page of my work and learning with this tool at filchyboy.github.io as a sort of daily recorder. I've kept a paper record for many years now but in keeping with learning in public I'll be adding to this periodically.
