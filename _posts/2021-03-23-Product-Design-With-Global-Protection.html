<h3>Product Design with Global Protection</h3>
<p>Last year in 2020, I made a cold connection with the <a href="https://globalprotection.com/">Global Protection</a> team to discuss the current state of a project for multi-sized condoms that I spearheaded something like 15 years ago. As I was then involved in the data science program at <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/">Lambda School</a>, this seemed like an opportunity to do some data exploration involving the product.</p>
<p>One of the minor pieces of the larger condom project back in the day was an analysis I made based on sales-per-state and sales-per-city. We were able to parlay this analysis into a lot of press and PR for the brand at the time. My work, written up in Wired and other national and local papers and magazines, was a lot of fun because people like to make comparisons between places. So sharing a story in which one state has "bigger" penises than another was great fodder for editors.</p>
<p>Much to my surprise, the team at Global responded, and we began a conversation that continued for months and ultimately led to my joining the crew.  Due to my depth of knowledge in the sector, I got heavily involved in product design for a new website rollout, which has become a rather large initiative. The team is excellent. I am enjoying my involvement with this company. Back when I worked in the reproductive space decades ago, Global Protection was a company for which I had great respect. I daresay they were then the best outfit in town, and it's incredibly gratifying to come back into the field with them.</p>
<p>There will be more updates on this project in the future.</p>
