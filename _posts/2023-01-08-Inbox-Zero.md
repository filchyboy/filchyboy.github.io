* In the fall I decided it was time to focus a bit of my energy towards tackling a huge backlog of emails. I learned serveral things in this process:

  * Unsubscribe these days is even more unreliable than it was a few years ago.
  * I receive a lot of marketing messages that I simply don't want and my respponse to this has been to simply ignore it. This has caused numerous issues I decided needed to be fixed.

* Today I deleted over 6k messages in the personal inbox I've maintained for over a decade. Long way to go but it feels good I am making progress towards my goal of getting a handle on my inboxes.
