# Daily Plan - Friday, January 30, 2026

## Today's Theme
I'm riding the wave of momentum from yesterday's work on locale-prefixed routing and SendGrid trigger sync. Both of these areas are fresh in my head from recent activity, and I want to push them forward while the context is still loaded. I've also been consistently investing in the billing reconciliation monitoring work this week, so I'll continue that thread as well.

## The Main Work

**Complete the locale-prefixed dashboard routing updates** - I was actively working on this yesterday, so all the routing logic and service provider patterns are fresh in my mind. I need to finish updating both the DashboardServiceProvider and AuthenticationServiceProvider with dual route registration. This is fundamental infrastructure that other internationalization work depends on.

**Push the SendGrid trigger sync routing to completion** - I've been deep in this recently and have the controller injection patterns loaded in my head. I'll update the SendGridConfigController constructor to inject all the Actions, then run PHPStan validation and the full SendGrid test suite. Getting this across the finish line will unblock the more complex routing logic I've been planning.

**Advance the billing reconciliation monitoring phase 1** - I've put 13 commits into this feature set this week, showing it's a strategic priority for me. The database foundation needs to be solid before I can build the monitoring logic on top. I'll create the migration for job retry/cancel/soft-delete fields and get the route registration wired up in billing.admin.php.

**Structure the integrations overview action** - This ties into my integrations hub work where I've been investing heavily (11 commits this week). I need to create the GetIntegrationsOverviewAction class structure to replace the synthetic data with real integration data. This is foundational work that everything else in the integrations domain builds on.

## Housekeeping

**Auto-fix the ESLint warnings** - I can knock out 1,226 auto-fixable warnings with a single `make lint-fix` command. That's a massive cleanup for minimal effort.

**Draft implementation plan for SendGridApiClient** - Since I'm already deep in SendGrid work today, I should outline the API client architecture while the domain knowledge is fresh. This planning directory directly supports my active SendGrid feature development.

**Refresh the lint harness snapshot** - It's 21 days stale, and I'll be touching code across multiple areas today. Running `make lint-harness-snapshot` will give me current quality baselines.

**Plan the integrations hub overview feature** - I'm actively working in the integrations domain, so I should draft the implementation plan for the hub overview while I have all the integration patterns loaded in my head.

## Parked

The 26 TypeScript errors across 11 files are likely import issues, but I don't want to context-switch into the frontend today while I'm making good progress on the backend routing and API work. I'll tackle those when I have a dedicated frontend session planned.

## Update - 11:37 AM

Spent the morning diving deep into that Dagger manifest issue that's been bugging me. Started by setting up a proper planning directory to map out the problem, then got into the meat of it - changing the BuildAssets function signature to return `(*dagger.Directory, error)` instead of what it was doing before. The key insight was that I needed to actually return the build directory from the container rather than just letting it disappear into the ether.

Once I had the code changes in place, I fired up the Mac mini for local testing to make sure everything was actually working as expected. The manifest generation is looking much cleaner now. Wrapped up by updating the staging-pipeline.md docs to reflect the new approach - nothing worse than fixing something and then forgetting to document the solution for future me.

## The Numbers
