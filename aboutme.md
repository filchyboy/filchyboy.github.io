title: A Bit of a Bio
subtitle: A synopsis of how I got from there to here with computers
---

My name is Christopher Filkins. For better or worse, I have been messing around with code since I was six years old or so back in 1972. My first experiences were on a paper-driven terminal, something like this one here from [IBM](https://github.com/filchyboy/filchyboy.github.io/blob/master/img/tumblr_n3vxusptAY1r49q4co1_500.jpg), connected to an Air Force mainframe through a phone cradle. Using this type of machine, I learned the basics of machine logic while connected to the mainframe through my father's work for the Air Force. These circumstances are how I first learned to use email, [telnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet), [Plan files](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/21387/plan-file#:~:text=In%20Unix%2C%20a%20plan%20file,the%20profile%20of%20another%20user.), and program basic logic into assembly & [FORTRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran#:~:text=Fortran%20%2F%CB%88f%C9%94%CB%90rt,numeric%20computation%20and%20scientific%20computing.).

When I was a bit older, I attended the [Albuquerque Academy](https://www.aa.edu/), where I discovered a community of programmers and the [Digital PDP-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11). One of my favorite pastimes was competing with other students to consume as much CPU time as possible in the [CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M) time-share so that others in my cohort received sluggish responses from the PDP. Doing this with flair and well-written calls was our goal, and I learned a lot about computers during this period of my life. This period was when I was first introduced to [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) & BASIC+ languages, although I continued to write a bit with FORTRAN.

Due to my continued interest in computers and his desire, my father purchased an [Osborne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Computer_Corporation) (or two) & eventually a [Kaypro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaypro). Having access to a computer at home helped me develop an even greater love and familiarity with these machines. During this period, I stopped working with FORTRAN but continued avidly growing my skill with BASIC and began learning MS-DOS, or DOS as we called it. The early 80's also brought tentative introductions to the [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) language and the [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) operating systems.

In high school and early in college, I began using [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.) computers for professional pre-press work, [QuarkXpress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuarkXPress) & [Photoshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop#:~:text=Photoshop%20was%20developed%20in%201987,images%20on%20a%20monochrome%20display.), in magazines, and book publishing houses. Later I transitioned to working computer support at the [University of New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Mexico). I set up accounts and ran tutorials for professors, teaching assistants, and students. I did everything from setting up students' email account to teaching professors how to use [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)) or [Listservs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list). This role began my journey communicating complicated computer instructions to the uninitiated.

During this period began my exploration of artificial intelligence and machine learning. What started as an exciting and compelling topic between my best friend and I became an all-consuming desire to learn how to allow computers to experience the world.  Since then, this has developed into a life-long pursuit.  Building our attempts at machine learning in the early 1990s was my first experience working in a cross-functional team. My partner and I explored "neuron-like" programming instances and tried to build our computer models with capacitors and resistors. 

Eventually, these efforts would lead us to [New Mexico University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_State_University) to study non-linear algebraic matrices in the [Department of Industrial Engineering](https://ie.nmsu.edu/) lab, which would go on to provide some fundamental pieces of the vision systems for the [M1 tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Abrams). Being young and naive, we left university to conquer the world with our ideas focusing on the toy sector. All of this was a significant learning experience and set me on the road to being an entrepreneur.

Moving to California, I soon took my skills with internet protocols and communication into a newly launched company called Beverly Hills Internet. I was hired as a contractor when the company had little more than the founder [David Bohnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bohnett) and a full-time developer. There I began developing content around teaching visitors how to use the technology stack that BHI was developing. I wrote one of the first "blogs" on the internet for the renamed company, [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities), that was eventually purchased by [Yahoo!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!) in 1999. I went on to work within the internet space during the [dotcom boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) for several companies learning several tech stacks and ultimately focusing on [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) (I am conversant in Perl, PHP, & Python). During this period, my skills grew to encompass all front end development, and I was soon asked to work on the back end.

After contracting to many of the top internet-based firms of the day, the challenge presented itself to rebuild a condom company from the ground up as an e-commerce vehicle. I spent over a decade developing both front end and back ends for [Condomania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_condoms). At that time, I led a cross-discipline team of customer support, logistics, and marketers. We built a completely new method of selling online to previously unknown niche markets and established a completely new consumer good segment. 

Aside from all of this, two specific successes there carried forward in delightful ways. One involved the development of search engine optimization. For my decade with the condom company, I consistently maintained the firm's ranking at the top of [SERP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_results_page).  I have since taken this skill set to many firms in other industries. In addition to this, I played a crucial role in the development of new technology in condoms, which produces condoms in sizes far more varied than any previous line. This new technology required significant changes to the production and logistics of condom manufacture, and I was there from the beginning, managing this process. After selling the company, the brand still exists today under the umbrella of the [Global Protection](https://globalprotection.com/). Both of these specific successes originate from my interest in developing cogent analysis and new opportunities by examining large data sets for insights.

After the condom company, I retired for a short while from the work-a-day of the tech industry and began consulting in positions where my experience and advice was valued more than my labor. During this period, I spent years rebuilding my physical practice and health after letting them deteriorate during the dotcom era.  

Later, I developed an end-to-end marketing system for a [VoIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP) company focused on the insurance industry, which allowed for emails to be sent to customers and leads with phone calls following the email's opening. Following this, I led the initial scope work on a system to allow realtor clients to scan [QR codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) to receive immediate phone calls from realtors.

I led the development of a [360-degree performance evaluation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-degree_feedback) for a sizeable burning man theme camp. This performance evaluation system, along with other management systems, for the camp resulted in measurable increases in the amount of distributed work for the group.  

Following these efforts, I began working with firms in the PR industry to help them bring data analysis to social media marketing and content development. Using these methods, I was able to produce increases in readership and engagement for a leading cannabis manufacturer and distributor in the hundreds of percent. Then I was able to take these same skills to a concierge medical firm that explicitly refused to allow their leads to know what exactly their practice entails.

Each of these assignments I have carried over the years has a common trait whereby I have worked to find patterns in large and contradictory data sets to produce measurable gains for my firms or employers. I find it compelling to solve puzzles.  To that end, I am today engaged in expanding my skillset in machine learning and large scale data analysis.
